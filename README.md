- ❌ Blockchain verification (users don't understand/care)

---

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES TO EMPHASIZE

### 3. **"Local Intelligence"**

    - **Solution**: Direct owner outreach, incentivize early listings
2. **Established Competition Response**
    - **Solution**: Focus on underserved segments, build community loyalty
3. **Cash Flow in Free Model**
    - **Solution**: Keep operations lean, monetize by month 6
