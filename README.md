## **User Reviews**

**99acres Reviews**

- Negative experiences with paid listings are common. Users state: “Don’t ever go for a paid listing with 99acres. They are cheaters. Taking customers’ money and not giving service… not even a single genuine lead turned up for a site visit throughout the entire subscription period”.
- Some call 99acres “a scam,” saying after payment, “you will not get any support,” leads are often irrelevant or fake, and support is unresponsive.
- Scattered positive feedback exists, such as: “Very good experience and I am very much satisfied with it,” but these are rare amid negative reviews.

**Magicbricks Reviews**

- Many users call it “fraudulent” and mention that “leads generated are fake and irrelevant,” or that package activation/support never materializes after payment.
- Reports of aggressive upselling are frequent: “The team is only concerned about extracting money. Salespeople lure you in with false promises just to take your money. Once you pay, the story completely changes.”
- A few reviews cite helpful support in isolated cases, e.g., “Magicbricks support team helped resolve the login problem on priority. Thanks Magicbricks team,” but overall trust is low.

**Housing.com Reviews**

- Premium plans are widely described as a “complete scam and do not deliver on any of its promises.” One user notes: “Paid for Premium Relax Plan – Got Nothing in Return! A Total Scam!” with complaints about irrelevant listings and poor support.
- Aggressive and misleading sales calls are called out: “Almost all the listings shown on their site are fake or misleading. The entire setup looks like a scam designed to trap genuine buyers and tenants”.
- Product issues include “outdated or inaccurate” listings and spammy promotional ads making it hard to find genuine properties; filter tools are also noted as buggy.

## **User Preference and Behavior Survey Insights**

- 75% of users prefer verified property listings over cheaper, unverified options. Verified listings build trust and reduce perceived risk, especially in markets plagued by fake or duplicate listings.
- About 60-65% of property buyers and renters trust community/locality reviews as much as or more than official platform data. Users rely heavily on peer reviews and resident feedback for authenticity and neighborhood insights.
- 42% of users abandon real estate platforms due to poor user experience (UX), including site/app speed issues, confusing navigation, and excessive ads, leading them to competitors.
- 88-90% of users have stopped using an app or website at some point due to bad performance, such as long loading times or crashes, emphasizing the need for optimized platform speed and stability.
- Up to 70% of users abandon property searches or transactions mid-way because of complicated or buggy interfaces, such as broken filters, poor mobile responsiveness, or ineffective communication tools.

## Key Insights

- **Magicbricks** leads in inventory size and listing numbers with strong filtering options and reliable buyer/seller tools. However, it lacks on-ground verification and immersive user experience features.
- **99acres** excels in filter flexibility, seller dashboards, and verified data but lacks advanced visual features like 3D tours and video reviews.
- **Housing.com** distinguishes itself with a modern interface, innovative locality insights (CFI, lifestyle ratings), 360° experiences, and short-form video reviews. It also offers strong verification tools for both buyers and sellers—particularly valuable in urban markets.
- **For agents/brokers**, all platforms offer advertising and lead management, but Housing.com uniquely provides verified agent features and advanced retargeting tools that enhance reach and authenticity.

Each platform offers distinct advantages depending on user needs—buyers/renters may prefer Housing.com for engagement and insights, sellers might choose Magicbricks for its inventory and dashboard tools, while agents/brokers would benefit from Housing.com's verification and marketing capabilities.

## Recommendations

1. **Zero Brokerage Model** → Not just cost-saving, it directly solves India's biggest real estate trust gap — broker malpractice and hidden fees. That's why users will switch faster.
2. **Enhanced Verification (Manual + Digital)** → Fake and duplicate listings remain the #1 frustration for users. Strong verification ensures trust, which is the foundation for long-term retention.
3. **Local Intelligence (Walkability, Lifestyle Ratings, CFI)** → Property decisions in India are family-driven. Locality safety, schools, and lifestyle data make the platform more human-centric, not just transactional.
4. **Community & Reviews** → Indians trust peer validation more than advertising. Real resident reviews create credibility, turning users into ambassadors of the platform.
5. **Mobile-First Performance (<3 sec load)** → 80%+ of Indian users search on mobile. Faster apps directly increase session times, conversions, and retention. Delay means losing market share.
6. **Trust Badges & Owner Verification** → Verified identity builds confidence in direct owner-buyer deals. This addresses fraud concerns and accelerates adoption of the zero-brokerage promise.
7. **Smart Recommendations & Alerts** → With price volatility high in Tier-1 & Tier-2 cities, personalized recommendations + trend alerts turn casual browsers into serious buyers.
8. **Direct Owner Incentives (Free Listings, Tools)** → Sellers are tired of paying brokers and portals. Giving them full control for free builds early inventory fast — solving the chicken-egg problem.
9. **Sustainability Features (Green, Energy, Water)** → Increasing awareness of eco-living among urban buyers means highlighting these features creates differentiation and future-proofs the platform.
10. **AI Chat & Predictive Tools** → As data scales, AI-based chat and price predictions will establish the platform as _the authority_ in market intelligence, locking in loyalty.
11. **Advanced Analytics for Agents/Brokers** → Agents spend heavily on ads but lack ROI clarity. Offering analytics makes the platform indispensable for them, ensuring repeat spend.
